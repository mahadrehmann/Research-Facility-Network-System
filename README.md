# Research Facility Network System

## Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a Research Lab Network System using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The network incorporates:
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Ensures secure communication between internal lab networks and external networks.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automates IP address allocation for efficient network management.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Provides dynamic routing for seamless inter-department connectivity.


## Objective

The primary goal was to interconnect research lab departments while ensuring secure, dynamic, and efficient network communication.



## Features
- **NAT Implementation:** 
  - Translates private IPs to public IPs for secure external communication.
- **DHCP Auto IP Assignment:** 
  - Dynamically allocates IP addresses to devices in each department.
- **RIP Routing:**
  - Establishes interconnectivity between departments using dynamic routing protocols.


## Results
1. Successfully tested packet communication between devices.
2. Configured NAT to translate private IPs (e.g., `192.168.50.12`) to public IPs for external communication.
3. Verified RIP routing between departments.


## Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Networking Protocols:** NAT, DHCP, RIP


## How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Simulate the network by testing communication between devices.
3. Explore the configurations for NAT, DHCP, and routing protocols.
